= Overview =
The Front End Form Plugin brings the awesomeness, and ease of use, of the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin for WordPress into the front end by generating a shortcode for each Field Group you create in ACF.
But it’s not just for creating a basic contact form. You can create quizes, interactive questionnaires, support request systems integrated with the Project Manager Plugin and more…
That shortcode (when placed into a Page, Post, Custom Post Type, Widget or any other area that accepts shortcode) will display the ACF Field Group you created so visitors can interact with it like they would any standard form you could have created with the faithful Contact Form 7, robust Formidable or dynamic Gravity Forms Plugins which – in all their glory – pale in comparison to the benefits of field creation and management with Advanced Custom Fields.

Apart from the basic ability to display your ACF Field Groups with shortcode you can also:

* **Receive Email Notifications Upon Submission** – We’ve extended ACF so that when someone submits a Front End Form that you are notified by email.
* **Auto Populates with Form Data (Optional)** – You can select a checkbox, for each form, to specify whether you want the email to be automatically populated with all of the form data.
* **Notification Customizing** – You can further customize your email notifications with content to your liking.
* **File Attachments** – When a file is uploaded to a form it’s not just saved to the database but it’s also sent to all recipients.
* **Standardized Forms** – You can set default values that are used for all of your forms, unless you’ve already customized them. So things like your submit button, successfully submitted message, email notifications and more can be set for all of your forms at once so you don’t waste time copying and pasting those values.
* **Create Interactive Test and Quizes** – Maybe you need to create a test or quiz that displays different questions and results based on the Users answers. Thanks to ACF and the Front End Form Plugin you can do that!
* **Database of Submissions** – All submissions are saved and accessible from it’s own, individual, menu item just like Pages and Posts display their own.
* **Integrates with the CPT UI Plugin** – For the ability to quickly create Custom Post Types to associate your Custom Fields with we recommend the CPT UI Plugin.
* **Create Posts** – You can create Posts from the submissions.
* **Edit Entries & Save Drafts** – Allow logged-in users to save drafts and edit their own entries, or even edit those submitted by others without seeing the admin area. You can optionally allow responses only from users who are logged-in.
